TODO:

-1: Make/test it in Windows? Then we would have more potential developers?
 0: Test packets/signal loss. (Perhaps this can be caused by not-in-time read from rtl-sdr driver).
 1: Make the relay to not only localhost but also other connected computer via network?
 2: Would Async mode rtl-sdr read be better than Sync mode?
 3: Make bi-directional UDP link to let C program accept Matlab's control?
 4: In-fly multi-dongles calibration algorithm. (Which signal is good candidate for this? GSM? 1090MHz ADS-B?)
 5: Any others?
